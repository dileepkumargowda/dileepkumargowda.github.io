        <h2>Fixed wakeup time</h2>
        <p>Fixing a time for a sleeping will be always better than sleeping at the time when body calls for.
        if you are not able to go to bed at same time everyday, atlest fix the time you wake up everyday
        no matter how much less sleep you get that day, and you can always catch up your sleep later in the day</p>
        
        <p>if you are not sleep deprived for continueous two to four days you can still manage less of sleep in one night
        and still do your worldly affairs quite well as usual.</p>
        
        <p>However if you distract your self everyday your fixed time of waking up it distrubs your way of starting a day
        it intern impact your day productivity towords your fixed current goal in sight.</p>
        
        <p>Follow the same timing no matter what and where you are. if you are in the place where you have nothing to do 
        waking up early then just go for a walk, or sit on your bed start revisiting your last day activities mentally or practice 
        gratittude listings whatever. Idea here is you wake up everyday fixed time no matter what, even you got just two hours 
        sleep in that perticular day.</p>

        <h2>Men, Dont go for facial massage before big event day</h2>
            <p>I had a engagement on 14th march, in hurry I went to known barber in bangalore asked him to do 
            something on my face so that I should look somewhat good, that was on 12th march means 2 days before
            the actual event day, he messaged me about one hour with electic rubber on my face with cream.
            its around 4 to 5 type of creams one after other.</p>

            <p>after that process i was looking lighter sinned, it felt good and loos feeling on my face.
            event went well no problem, but after 3 days of event I started to notice small pinples all over my
            forhead and cheeks, after around 10th day of massage they started to reduce in numbers.</p>

            <p>My suggetion is if you are not taken the massage of those perticular creems dont try then when your event
            is near by like within two or three days. Because you dont know what effect it will have on your skin in 
            two days.</p>

            <p>if you are already tested with that no problem.it applays only to those dont bother to take face massage often
            and want to take it when event day is ahead.

        <h2>Dont use Bro, Dude,Man, words alot in your communication</h2>

        <p>While using the words like, bro, dude, man, sis, these kind of words in our day to day communication may make us connected
        yet its hard to take those people seriously in professional settings.</p>

        <p>for me people who use those words looks collage hippies, its good if you use with selected one or tow
            people in your closed cicles but using those words in office environmant is decradful to your profession.
        </p>
        <p>
        for example I use the word Macchi, only with one of my close friend, it feels good and deeply connected with 
        depth of bonding but if i start using same word I can not say people will take me for serious in whatever I has to say

        <h2>Get use to being empty of concepts</h2>
        <p>There is a saying in zen "know nothing, have noting" just be.</p>
        <p>if we observe mind is thinking about one other concepts, there is constant narrationg of stories,
             theories and concepts. if we try harder to stop them that becomes the story of how to stop thinking.</p>
        <p>Let everythihng come and go. watch the tendency to plan somthing, seek somthing or straive for somsthing all the time
            you are planning to do something, planning to undo something, you are waiting for what is to come,
            ther are always a concerns of one or other all the time bothering one way or other.</p>
        <p>watch the tendency to criticize someone or somthing, correct.
            Look, how much we think about other people, commit yourself not to think, talk and discuss about other people
            when its not needed.
